					St. Catherine of Alexandria Parish which is also called the

					<h4> Visit of the Pilgrim Image of the 
					Black Nazarene </h4>
					<p> The Diocese of San Fernando de La Union is the 
					second in Ilocandia to be visited by the image of 
					the Black Nazarene. It came at La Union last November 
					26, 2018 and departed this December 2, 2018 only. 
					Devotees from different parishes of the Diocese of 
					San Fernando de La Union gathered for the welcoming 
					procession for the Pilgrim Image of the Black Nazarene
					along the San Fernando National Highway, followed by a
					Eucharistic Celebration presided over by Rev. Fr. Roberto
					Benito Collado and the one who gave us a meaningful homily is Rev. 
					Fr. Douglas Badong held at Saint William the Hermit 
					Cathedral Parish, November 26. In the first day of the 
					Black Nazarene in our diocese, we continue to pray for the 
					needs of our brothers and sisters, that we may have generous 
					hearts to help them in their needs. <br> <br>

					<p> Since it's the Rosary Month, we usually conduct Block Rosary
					in the houses of the Youth Ministers. We pray in front of the Blessed
					Virgin Mary and it gives us a sense of calmness and peacefulness. It
					also gives us opportunities to bond with each other as we go deeper and
					stand firmer in our faith.
